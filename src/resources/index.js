            Kamaruka was established in 2001 to provide a more appropriate educational environment for 
            boys diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperac tivity Disorder (ADHD).
            `,
                    `
            As the name suggests, attention deficit is a problem with concentration.
            `,
                    `
            The mainstream classroom, typically with 20 or more students, cannot provide the environment 
            conducive to learning for boys with this disorder. Their need for a consistent approach to discipline 
            and structure in their lives is not possible with the diversity of teaching styles 
            they would encounter in a regular school setting.
            `,
                    `
            With a staff/student ratio of approximately 5:1 in secondary and 3:1 in primary classes, 
            boys who have fallen behind academically can be given personalised attention to overcome their 
            weaknesses and restore their self-esteem.
            `,
                    `
            The timetable is deliberately weighted towards physical activity and academic 
            classes are interspersed with a more “hands on” activity to reduce the length 
            of time the boys have to sit and concentrate.

            Over a period of two or three years, the intervention program at Kamaruka aims to 
            address the social inadequacies and emotional issues associated with learning difficulties. 
            `,
                    `
            Behavioural change is accomplished through a system of rewards and consequences, 
            challenging boys to accept responsibility for the choices they make.
            `,
                    `
            Boys between the ages of 8 to 15 years, who have low-esteem, but with average or 
            above average IQ, will benefit immensely from the positive experiences and a sense of belonging.
            `,
                    `
            The social skills training, strategies to self-manage behaviour and develop organisational skills, 
            all in a very structured school environment, make the program particularly suited to boys exhibiting 
            symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

                    At the August Census in 2017, Kamaruka had an enrolment of 39 students 
                    (18 primary and 21 secondary).

                    Procedures are in place, at Kamaruka, to ensure that school attendance is regular 
                    and students are punctual. Selective enrolments aim to create an environment of motivated 
                    students focusing on academic achievement. Students with a history of school refusal are 
                    unlikely to succeed in the Kamaruka program and are rarely enrolled.
                    `,
                    `
                    As the primary enrolments have been progressively increasing, it was decided that 
                    a primary annex should be established to separate the primary students from the 
                    negative influence of secondary boys.

                    `
                    The Primary Annex (the ground floor at 38 River St 4 doors down from the main building) 
                    was opened at the start of the school year in February 2016. Late in 2017, the first floor 
                    became available and was leased, with the intention of moving the primary classes to a more 
                    spacious environment in 2018, thus accommodating more students.

                    A number of the students at Kamaruka attend counseling during school hours on a

                        `Illicit Drug Use Policy`,
                        `Rationale`,
                        `• 	Illegal drug use in schools is a social, health and legal problem 
                    that needs to be addressed in accordance with protocols established between 
                    the Department of Education and the Victorian Police Force.`,
                        `• 	The boys enrolled at Kamaruka Education Centre are more vulnerable to 
                    the influence of peers and consequently need greater vigilance and protection.`,
                        `• 	In keeping with the general philosophy of the school, any student or 
                    member of the Kamaruka Education Centre community who is deemed by the 
                    principal to have a detrimental influence on another student’s progress 
                    will not be allowed to continue as a member of that community.`,
                        `Aims`,
                        `\t• \tTo provide a school environment that is free of illicit drugs, 
                    and safe for all staff and students.`,
                        `Implementation`,
                        `• 	As educators we have a legal responsibility to take reasonable measures 
                    to protect students in our care from reasonably foreseeable risks of injury, 
                    including risks associated with illicit drugs.`,
                        `• 	Harm minimisation is the prevailing approach that our school adopts 
                    in the implementation of our drug education prevention and 
                    intervention program for all students.`,
                        `• 	It is unacceptable that any student or staff member to use, 
                    possess, supply or be under the influence of illicit drugs at school, 
                    at a school function or in the vicinity of the school or its students.`,
                        `• 	Any staff who is the driver of the school bus must not have alcohol 
                    or drugs present in his or her blood or breath immediately before, or 
                    while driving the bus and must comply with any guidelines regarding the 
                    form and content of alcohol and drug management policies issued by the 
                    Safety Director (sections 56-57, Bus Safety Act).`,
                        `• 	Despite the best efforts of our staff, the use of illicit 
                    drugs may still impact upon our school.`,
                        `• 	It is incumbent upon a school to act whenever cases of drug 
                    use or illegal or criminal activity occur, or are suspected to have occurred at school.`,
                        `• 	Students who appear to be affected by drugs who attend school 
                    or are within the vicinity of the school or a school function will 
                    be managed in the following way as deemed appropriate by the principal:`,

                        `• 	Medical assistance and support will be sought when required.`,
                        `• 	The school principal will be informed.`,
                        `• 	Any drugs or paraphernalia that can be easily collected will be 
                    safely gathered and disposed of in accordance with council procedures.`,
                        `• 	The parents or guardians of the student/s involved will be contacted.`,
                        `• 	Notify Health or Welfare services if appropriate.`,
                        `• 	Whether or not the principal informs all parents or students 
                    of incidents involving drugs at school is a matter of circumstances 
                    and degree, but the principal’s legal duty is to ensure that the 
                    school environment is, as far as practicable, safe and free from risks.`,
                        `• 	Teachers have a duty of care to pass on information to the principal 
                    if they have knowledge about illicit drug use by students on or outside 
                    school grounds. Under this duty of care staff cannot promise 
                    unconditional confidentiality to students.`,
                        `• 	Principals must advise the local police contact person 
                    when they have knowledge of an alleged criminal offence, 
                    including the possession, use and distribution of illicit drugs.`,
                        `• 	Any student who is absent from school due to drug use or 
                    the resultant treatment should be provided access to 
                    appropriate services and information on counselling.`,
                        `• 	The principal will inform students and parents via 
                    newsletters and the Student Code of Conduct that school lockers 
                    and desks are school property and may be searched without notice.`,
                        `• 	Students suspected of illicit drugs in school bags or personal 
                    clothing are to be separated from other students and supervised while 
                    a search is conducted. A principal or principal’s delegate can conduct 
                    the search of a school bag or clothing in the company of another 
                    responsible adult if there is a reasonable suspicion that the student is in possession of drugs.`,
                        `• 	Any student who supplies illicit drugs or influences another 
                    student to take illicit drugs will be reported to the police and expelled.`,

                        `Children with ADHD have an urgent need to be taught strategies to manage their 
                    disorder sufficiently so that they may function successfully in the wider society. 
                    Initial intervention should address the low self-esteem 
                    often a consequence of academic underachievement.`,
                        `Self-confidence can be raised through successful experiences. Utilising an individual 
                    academic program at a standard comparable to each student’s ability, 
                    success is guaranteed and students can progress.`,
                        `Initially allowances are made for their disability, but progressively as confidence grows, 
                    students are challenged with situations that they will encounter once reintegrated in 
                    mainstream education. To facilitate inclusion after the intervention period, 
                    behaviour management strategies and social skills must be a major component of the program.`,
                        `Prevention is the best behaviour management strategy and can be achieved by:`,
                        `• 	Ensuring that each student is succeeding academically by 
                    adopting a curriculum appropriate to their ability level`,
                        `• 	Providing a supportive and structured classroom 
                    environment with minimal distraction`,
                        `• 	Being aware of what teaching techniques and ways of speaking 
                    to students can either increase or decrease the likelihood of misbehaviour.`,
                        `• 	Being aware of ADHD behaviours and how they affect a student’s 
                    performance in the classroom eg. inattention vs noncompliance.`,
                        `Proactive Classroom Management Strategies`,
                        `Students with ADHD are often difficult to motivate. Consequently, 
                    their academic performance often depends on their relationship with their teacher. 
                    If a teacher likes and respects the students, they will return that 
                    respect and are more likely to accept instructions.`,
                        `The following strategies are very useful for the education of these children:`,
                        `• 	Make an effort to get to know students personally – their interests and hobbies.`,
                        `• 	Greet students at the door by name.`,
                        `• 	Develop and maintain a daily classroom and homework routine.`,
                        `• 	Have a few good rules that are clear and concise and post them up in the classroom.`,
                        `• 	Use a diary to enter homework, assignment dates etc. 
                    and be vigilant with organisational skills.`,
                        `• 	As often as possible, reprimand privately in a calm, 
                    unemotional voice and immediately a rule is broken.`,
                        `• 	Praise frequently for any achievement no matter how insignificant it may seem to you.`,
                        `• 	Be aware of peak medication effect when challenging students with difficult work.`,
                        `• 	Allow time-out for restless students who are at risk of blowing up.`,
                        `• 	Schedule academic classes for approximately one hour 
                    followed by a period with less academic demands. Use physical or hands-on activities frequently.`,
                        `Teaching Strategies`,
                        `• 	Give assignments that are not too difficult or too long`,
                        `• 	State goals clearly.`,
                        `• 	Give step-by-step instructions – No multi-step directions at once.`,
                        `• 	Relate information to their personal experience.`,
                        `• 	Teach with enthusiasm.`,
                        `• 	Be concise and avoid lengthy lectures.`,
                        `• 	Invite frequent active response from students.`,
                        `• 	Establish ground rules and cues to listen.`,
                        `• 	Get student’s attention before giving instructions.`,
                        `• 	Be specific about what you want the student to do.`,
                        `• 	Repeat directions, paraphrase and write directions on the board.`,
                        `• 	Check with individuals for understanding.`,
                        `• 	Give immediate and frequent feedback on their progress.`,
                        `• 	Make positive comments frequently and limit negative wording.`,
                        `• 	Give students choices but limit them to two or three.`,
                        `• 	Eliminate criticism and blame.`,
                        `• 	Give I messages.`,
                        `• 	Avoid public embarrassment.`,
                        `• 	Acknowledge the student’s feelings.`,
                        `• 	Lower your voice- stay calm, keep strong emotions out of your voice.`,
                        `• 	Be non-threatening – Don’t get in his face, put your

                        `Duty of Care`,
                        `Whenever a student-teacher relationship exists, the teacher has a duty of care. 
                    This is defined as: “A teacher is to take such measures as are reasonable in 
                    the circumstances to protect a student under the teacher’s charge from 
                    risks of injury that the teacher should reasonably have foreseen.`,

                     for supervision as are necessary according to the circumstances at

                    reasonably expected, protected from injury.`,
                        `Staff Absences`,
                        `Student learning is greatly affected by the quality of teaching that they experience. 
                    Because of the social/emotional difficulties of the students, a replacement teacher 
                    is not an option. To ensure that the students receive high quality learning opportunities 
                    despite the absence of regular teachers, the following strategies will be employed:`,
                        `• 	A teacher who does not have other teaching 
                    responsibilities and has the expertise will cover the class.`,
                        `• 	A specialist program will be cancelled and swapped with another class.`,
                        `• 	The day may be shared between other teachers so as to cause 
                    minimal disruption to their programs and to share the additional 
                    time that may be required over several weeks.`,

                    for the Principal and other key staff should they need to be absent at short notice.`,
                        `• 	All staff requiring a relief teacher are requested to contact 
                    the Principal as soon as possible to maximise the opportunity to 
                    rearrange the timetable and minimise the disruption to the program.`,

                    by the Principal in the upstairs classroom.`,
                        `• 	At the end of the school day, students who are dismissed are 
	                to leave the school building and make their way home. Students 
	                who are being picked are to remain in the classroom with a 
	                teacher until the parent/guardian arrives.`,

                        `• 	It is advisable for parents to have ambulance cover.

                    patrolled by lifeguards from Surf Life Saving Victoria. 
                    Students will only be permitted to surf/swim between the flags 
                    and will be supervised by two staff members as well as lifeguards.`,
                        `• 	A male staff member will be positioned in each of the dormitories 
                    at surf camps. No student will be permitted to enter the 
                    dormitories without permission from a teacher.`,
                        `• 	Tents at bush camps will be positioned within a perimeter 
                    of the staff tents, such that students are visible and within hearing range.`,
                        `• 	An emergency beacon and walkie-talkies will be carried 
                    when travelling to isolated areas during bush camps.`,
                        `• 	An emergency plan will be developed when accessing remote 
                    areas for bush camps. The plan will include contact details of 
                    local authorities and communication with a staff member at school on designated days.`,

                    remains at school well beyond the normal time of collection,

                        The reasonable person test applies. That is, would a reasonable person,
                         given all the circumstances, have anticipated that the behaviour

                        cause offence, humiliation or intimidation.`,
                        `Sexual harassment is unwelcome, uninvited conduct that is offensive 
                        from the viewpoint of the person harassed, 
                        regardless of any innocent intent on the part of the offender.`,
                        `It is not behaviour that is based on mutual attraction between people or friends.`,

                        `Types of sexual harassment`,

                        verbal or written. It is not just the obvious harassment of 
                        unwelcome physical behaviour such as inappropriate touching, 
                        patting, brushing up against someone or offensive gesturing. 
                        Sexual harassment can either be direct or indirect.`,
                        `Sexual harassment takes a variety of forms, including:`,

                        `• 	Sexual propositions or requests for dates`,
                        `• 	Repeated questions about a person’s private life`,
                        `• 	Sexual jokes and innuendo`,

                        against a person, hugging etc. against a person’s will`,
                        `• 	Offensive telephone calls, reading matter, email, screen savers, pictures, calendars etc.`,
                        `• 	Suggestive looks or leers`,
                        `• 	Sexually explicit conversations`,
                        `Bullying is repeated, unreasonable behaviour directed

                        `Unreasonable behaviour is behavior that a reasonable person, having 
                        regard to all the circumstances, would expect to victimise,

                         repeated or occurring as part of a pattern of behaviour, could be considered bullying:`,
                        `• 	verbal abuse`,
                        `• 	excluding or isolating employees`,

                        `• 	assigning meaningless tasks unrelated to the job`,
                        `• 	giving employees impossible assignments`,
                        `• 	deliberately changed work rosters to inconvenience particular employees`,
                        `• 	deliberately withholding information vital for effective work performance`,
                        `The list is not exhaustive. Other types of behaviour may also constitute bullying. 
                        Bullying is usually not a once off incident but could be if 
                        the once off incident is sufficiently serious.`,
                        `Bullying does not include reasonable and legitimate actions of Kamaruka Education Centre in

                        `There are a number of ways to respond to an incident once it has been reported, 
                        and the procedure used, is dependant on the particular student’s history.`,
                        `In the first instance, a non-punitive approach will be adopted. The principal 
                        will work closely with the student to develop empathy for the student being 
                        bullied or harassed, and will identify strategies to ensure that the bullying stops.`,
                        `The student, who is the target of such bullying or harassment, will be offered 
                        support and guidance through a meeting with the principal and/or other staff member.`,
                        `A repeat offence will invoke the punitive approach, which involves the establishment 
                        of clear rules and expectations about appropriate behaviours, and graduated consequences 
                        for the harassment or bullying behaviour. A meeting with parents/guardians will consider 
                        the future enrolment of the student and the most appropriate consequence, which may 
                        include professional counselling.`,

                        others to make the victim feel threatened or embarrassed.`,
                        `Mobile phone calls – silent calls or abusive messages; or stealing the victim’s

                        Cyber-bullying leaves no physical scars so it is, perhaps, less evident to a parent or teacher, 
                        but it is highly intrusive and the hurt it causes can be very severe.`,
                        `Young people are particularly adept at adapting to new technology,

                        `Interviews by DHHS Child Protection workers would normally be carried

                        `In many cases where it is suspected that a child has been, or is at risk of 
                        being abused, it is extremely important that parents/carers are notified as

                        `Kamaruka Education Centre will take all complaints under this
                         policy very seriously and will invoke either
                          the informal or formal complaints procedure outlined below.`,
                        `If an informal approach is taken and a mutually satisfactory result
                         is not achieved, then a formal approach can be adopted. 
                         If the complaint is sufficiently serious, a formal 
                         approach may be taken without first invoking the informal approach.`,

                        committee member, is appointed to take details of the complaint 
                        and formally investigate the matter.`,
                        `The investigation is a confidential process where details of the 
                        complaint are taken and provided to the respondent for a formal response. 
                        The allegation is investigated by an independent and impartial person, 
                        whose task is to gather evidence or facts that may either 
                        substantiate or refute the allegations.`,
                        `The parties involved in the investigation process will be
                         asked to maintain confidentiality with respect to the complaint
                          and the investigation. Kamaruka Education Centre may, however, 
                          need to divulge the contents of the complaint and responses
                           in order to complete a full investigation.`,
                        `The principle of natural justice demands that the process be 
                        based upon an assumption of innocence unless and until evidence shows otherwise.`,
                        `Reported findings then form the basis of appropriate action
                         by Kamaruka Education Centre to respond to both the individual
                          and organisational matters addressed in the findings.`,
                        `Possible Outcomes`,
                        `The possible outcomes will depend upon the nature of the 
                        complaint. Where an investigation has found that a complaint
                         is substantiated, appropriate action will be taken against
                          the person about whom the complaint was made. 
                          This may include disciplinary action up to and 
                          including dismissal of employment in serious cases.`,
                        `Victimisation`,
                        `Victimisation is treating someone unfairly because that person,
                         or someone they associate with, has made, or intends to make,
                          a complaint under this policy. It is unlawful to victimise or
                           penalise a person for making a complaint in good faith`,

                        anyone who makes a complaint or assists in making a genuine 
                        complaint is supported and not penalised in any way.`,
                        `Immediate disciplinary action will be taken against any

                        practical joke, disciplinary measures will be taken.`,
                        `This policy will be reviewed as part of the school’s
